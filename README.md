# 3D-Design-Software

The motive of this project is to reduce the loss of cattle and ensure the safety of tribal communities by mapping wild-animal movement zones. 
By identifying safe and high-risk regions, the project aims to protect livestock, improve awareness, help decision-making for grazing routes, 
and provide safety guidance for tourists and local residents in forest-adjacent areas.
